## How can you access our website?
*Here's How:*

1. First, install Flask [Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-web-application-using-flask-and-python-3)
2. Once Flask is downloaded, go to the *app.py* page in this repository and open Terminal
3. Input 'export FLASK_APP=hello' and then 'export FLASK_ENV=development' and finally 'flask run'

The FLask environment should be loading, and just input the link given into your browser and run!
Here is the link that I recieved: 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
