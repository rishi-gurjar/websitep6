    <h1>Basketball.</h1>
    <p>Basketball has become a well known sport that has even gone to professional levels. This was all thanks to James Naismath who invented the sport. Basketball is a sport where it is normally played with two teams against each other. These teams consist of 5 players. This game starts off with a jump ball, and whoever gets that will try to score on the opposite basket. The time of the professional level of basketball consists of 4 ten minute quarters. Whoever has the most points in the end wins.</p>
